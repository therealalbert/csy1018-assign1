He passed his High School from Little Angels' College and now he is enrolling in NAMI college as a student of computing.he does not have that mush idea about information technology but he was interested in programming since his high school and that is the reason why he is here at NAMI College. He would like to call myself as a "Deep Thinker". He love to play with my computer and other gadgets like mobile phones. He likes to play football and table tennis too. There are many ideas knocking the door of his brain about the future of technology. To get the solutions, he is reading IT and hopefully he will get the way through this in coming future. </p><!--This is the end of the paragraph-->
